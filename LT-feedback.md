***Project 1: Hot 100***  
This is great! Not much to be said other than to ensure you have a solid, ready to be used dataset!  


***Project 2: Spotify/Songkick***  
This one is great, but will be a bit more challenging because the goal is a bit more abstract. You may have to spend a bit of time structuring the problem. What will you be modeling in this case? If it is Spotify Track Popularity as a function of the Songkick event data and other writer/producer data, does this causally imply that track popularity on Spotify?


***Project 3: Spotify Trending***  
Awesome! This is definitely doable. How do they define trending? Trending/Not_Trending? Or chart position? You are also going to want to grab a diverse sample of genres, songs, regions (just US or more?), chart positions and non-chart position tracks.


*As I mentioned before, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find some fall back datasets. Any dataset is fine, as long as it is well-structured. If things become a bit too difficult, it's very important to have a fallback you can rely on!*
