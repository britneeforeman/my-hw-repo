**Overall:** Fantastic job on this assignment! You clearly are ontop of most of these concepts, and laid out a perfect plan for working through the dataset. I don't have any notes for now, so just start reviewing/practicing pandas before your next assignment!


**Some Notes**

* **Bonus Qs** You definitely could drop the two missing values, but given there are only a few missing values in GRE and GPA, you *could* impute those missing values. In other words, you wouldn't necessarily disturb the underlying distribution much by imputing say the mean, or median, into those missing values, while still retaining that data! As we will discuss later, these models benefit from more, and more data in them. Check out this [quick guide](https://chrisalbon.com/python/pandas_missing_data.html)! Now, prestige could be imputed with the mode, or it could be dropped all together.

**Something to think about**

***Note: Given you already have some solid exposure to data analysis and SQL, if you ever feel a topic is too elementary or you want more, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings! I can send things your way, especially once we get into modeling!***
